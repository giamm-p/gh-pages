A group of young companies working to build a product and/or launch a product in the market to solve a specific problem.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The hard truth is that, although the definition above rings true to some extent, there is such an incredible degree of variety in the startup world. People who are interested in joining the startup world should keep in mind that, like a Tardis, it's way bigger once you’re on the inside.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">If you're looking for a new opportunity, understanding the different types of startups and their stages is going to make all the difference when it comes to finding what you're looking for.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">First of all, let's begin with the distinction between tech and deep tech companies.&nbsp;<br></p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tech vs deep tech</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In today's world, a tech startup is usually defined as an ICT (Information and Communications Technology) company where the main challenge to bring a product to market is linked to the market itself, rather than the technology.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">To understand what it means, let's start by saying that this definition applies today but it has not always been true. In fact, during the 90s, the arrival of the internet gave many entrepreneurs the opportunity to create completely new ICT-based solutions, that had an intrinsic technical challenge, because the industry was still nascent.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">After more than 2 decades of innovation, the technical complexity of creating an ICT company is far lower than before. This is why the main challenge a new company faces is to enter the market, which could be boiled down to building products users want and acquiring more users over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, <strong id=\"\">a deep tech company has a novel technology at its core and the associated technical challenges are as important as entering into the market, if not more.</strong> Usually, deep tech companies start with a scientific or technological discovery made by scientists and engineers in the lab, where some inventors see a potential path to commercialization. These companies span many fields, from life sciences, medical technology, clean technology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence and many more.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">What are the unique characteristics of deep tech startups?&nbsp;</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">It takes more time, resources and talent to develop a market-ready technology</li><li id=\"\">The technical challenges are not only limited to the R&amp;D phase, but also to inventing and adapting manufacturing processes at scale. More often than not, this leads companies to build their own manufacturing facilities to build the entire product or only some of its components</li><li id=\"\">While for a tech startup the best path forward is usually achieved by defining the problem, talking to users and rapidly iterating on the product; a deep tech startup lays its foundation on the Intellectual Property (IP) developed within a certain field, which is then utilized to target a specific application</li></ul><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1274px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1274px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6005911b73ad3288752b8fa5/6213719d93f22baabf37a888_Deep%20tech%20vs%20tech.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Factors: deep tech vs general tech\" id=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></div></figure><p id=\"\">It should be clear by now that deep tech companies require more resources to come to fruition, both in terms of time, talent and capital.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">We're going to focus specifically on life sciences and technology companies but most insights hold true for the other deep tech categories.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">What are the needs and challenges of a deep tech startup?</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Research collaboration</strong>: the core technology is often created in Universities and Research Institutes for whom paving the road for smooth commercialization is rarely a priority High funding requirements&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">TRLs - Technology Readiness Levels</strong>: a lower TRL offers more optionality in terms of applications but also increases the risk to develop and deploy the solution</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Market readiness</strong>: the target customer base might be more or less mature to adopt new technology.

Most tech startups never get to product market fit, but the ones that do rapidly acquire new users, attract more investments and scale the business.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In a deep tech company, the R&amp;D phase can last multiple years and is usually financed by universities, governments and small investors. Entering a market for the first time usually does not trigger a rapid expansion but it looks more like validating the first use case, which will slowly trigger more adoption in the same market, before potentially moving to another market, where different entry barriers might create new challenges.&nbsp;</p><figure id=\"\" class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1200px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"1200px\"><div id=\"\"><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6005911b73ad3288752b8fa5/621371fbecda89743ed9b70d_Graph%20of%20stages.png\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Stages of a regular startup vs a deep tech startup\" id=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></div><figcaption id=\"\">Source: <a href=\"https://dealroom.co/\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"\">Dealroom</a></figcaption></figure><p id=\"\">‍</p><p id=\"\">The remaining part of this article will focus on how it feels to work at each phase of a deep tech company and how it impacts talent looking to join a startup.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">R&amp;D phase&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Employees: 2-10&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Location: university lab or science park&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Valuations: &lt;€5M&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Funds raised: €0-2M&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Investors: universities, public organizations through grants, business angels&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">The seeds of a deep tech startup usually come from an academic laboratory or a research institution that received funding to investigate a specific field, sometimes as a quest for exploration, other times to answer a broad unmet need.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">During this process, which could take many years or even decades, <strong id=\"\">a core breakthrough innovation is developed, which can still have many unique applications, therefore retaining a high degree of optionality.</strong><br>It's in the hands of the inventors to identify the right beachhead application, which in return will define the product characteristics. The risk in this phase is to become a \"solution looking for a problem\", which all evidence says it's a dangerous path for everyone involved.</p><p id=\"\">This phase feels a lot like an extension of a PhD or PostDoc. Most founders are transitioning from a purely technical focus to a more commercial mindset and are starting to delegate technical tasks to their team, which is usually made of other researchers or engineers who might be employed by the university or financed by government grants while working on the startup.</p><p id=\"\">As soon as a commercial future appears on the horizon, new boundaries and different roadmaps appear compared to a pure research project. This means facing new challenges around processes, boundary conditions, impossibility to use certain materials or methods and so on.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The exciting feeling of building a world-changing solution is compensated by the fact that things in the lab hardly work out the first time and sleepless nights will be spent trying to solve unexpected challenges.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">If you join a startup at this stage, you're part of the founding team and you'll be asked to do a little bit of everything.</strong> You'll have to be comfortable with an almost unbearable degree of responsibility and self-direction.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You'll face the same daily question every founder has: <strong id=\"\">\"What should I work on today?\"</strong>. It will look like there are always more fires than you could ever handle and it's your job to prioritize what to focus on so that it moves you and your entire team closer to your goals.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Working at a startup at this stage feels a lot like being part of a family and chances are that you'll spend more time with them than your actual family, from having lunch together to hanging out after work.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Being part of such a team in an academic environment also feels like playing a different game compared to every other researcher around you so you'll tend to spend even more time with your team and people working at other startups as you'll easily relate to each other.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Building the right team at this stage is key for long-term company success, although many people underestimate its importance.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The reason is that you're not just hiring the first 10 people. If you succeed, you've actually hired hundreds of people, because those first hires are going to grow into leaders and hire tens of people each.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Getting those first hires right will set you for success and the team will get stronger as it gets larger. On the other hand, even a single bad hire can set such a young company up for disaster.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">At this stage, hires usually come from the same university network where the technology has been developed and they have a strong technical background, even if their job might evolve in the future to more commercial roles.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Joining a startup at this stage is not for everyone. Salaries are usually below average and although the potential of the technology is clear, the risk of failure is extremely high.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Go-to-market&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Employees: 11-30</li><li id=\"\">Location: independent lab or science park plus one or more offices&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Valuations: €5-20M&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Funds raised: €2-10M</li><li id=\"\">Investors: specialized investors, corporates and large international funding schemes&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">This phase of the startup life begins when the company has the first product in the market or is undergoing in-human trials.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Leveraging some initial traction with pilots, clinical trials, collaborations and technology de-risking, allowed the team to raise some money from professional investors who saw real commercial potential in your technology.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This means that people working at the startup can now get real salaries and the team will expand with a few people who have technical understanding and commercial expertise. More capital and a stronger track record also allows companies in this stage to start attracting senior professionals to lead specific functions.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">The founder is often not involved in day-to-day technology challenges and can focus on paving the road to partnerships with larger stakeholders and institutions, facilitating the future market adoption of the product.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">At this stage, R&amp;D efforts are still ongoing but a first version of the product has to be finalized to validate its use under different conditions and apply for regulatory clearance as needed.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=\"\">While the R&amp;D team keeps working on product iterations to improve outcomes or adapt the product for different applications, many team members will take on roles that require a deep technical understanding but do not involve working in the lab.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">These roles can be quality assurance, regulatory affairs, business development, clinical operations, project management and so on.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">If you're curious to learn more about those roles, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kickigai.com/career-guides\" id=\"\">career guides</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Working in a company in the early go-to-market phase feels like a more diluted version of the pure R&amp;D phase craziness.</strong> New hires have more defined roles and more or less clear objectives. Sometimes a single person has to be responsible for an entire department but the number of fires a single employee has to deal with are way more limited than in the previous phase.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Overall, it still feels like a close group of people working to achieve an important mission but there is more structure and the influence of external stakeholders such as investors, large partners and public institutions contributes to the feeling that a research project is turning into a fully-fledged company.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Towards the late part of this phase, companies with proven technology and proven market readiness are able to raise a lot of capital to scale their operations and this is when there might be some comparison with the hypergrowth phase of tech startups.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Being an employee at a company at this stage can change drastically in just a few years but you're usually asked to <strong id=\"\">find new areas to add value to the organization so you can facilitate internal processes and align them with external objectives.</strong> This also includes building systems, hiring and training new people.</p><p id=\"\">Also,<strong id=\"\"> building personal leverage</strong> becomes key to making the most out of any incoming changes, which will also allow you to grow personally and professionally.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Growth&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Employees: 30-200&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Location: proprietary laboratories and offices&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Valuations: €50-200M&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Funds raised: €50-100+M&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Investors: generalist growth investors and corporates&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">This phase is characterized by having one or more products already in multiple markets alongside an overall market readiness that allows the company to invest in distribution, marketing and sales to reach its customers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">A lot of deep tech companies never fully experience this phase</strong> because they get acquired as soon as signs of early growth are visible.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">This happens for a variety of reasons, here are 3 important ones:&nbsp;</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">The inefficiency of building in-house international sales and distribution capabilities compared to adding a new product to those same frameworks that already exist in established companies&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">The appetite of investors to get a return on their investment, especially when the path to the public markets is not clear&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">The willingness of a large player (usually a market leader) to consolidate its market position&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">For the companies that reach the growth phase, major shifts happen:&nbsp;</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">The scientists/founders who have led the company so far step down from executive roles and experienced managers come to lead a company that operationally has little to do with the startup of just a few years ago&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Communication becomes challenging and behavioural norms turn into something to be defined within groups, rather than company-wide&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Silos and multiple layers of management emerge&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">A company at this stage can hardly be considered a startup</strong> and it is a valid alternative to working at a large company in terms of salary, career opportunities and skills that you'll develop.&nbsp;<br></p>",

It may sound not that odd when realizing that it comes from the fusion of two words from different languages.</p><p>The first word is \"<strong>kick</strong>\", which in English means literally to hit something forcefully with your foot. To be kicked by something also means that it makes you feel very excited or very happy for a short period of time.</p><p>The second one is \"<strong>ikigai</strong>\", a Japanese word that indicates what is your purpose in life, both personally and professionally. It is the reason why a person gets up in the morning and feels fueled to start the day.</p><p>The ikigai theory takes into consideration four aspects to design a meaningful and fulfilling career.</p><p>These aspects are:</p><p>- What you love<br>- What you are good at<br>- What you can be paid for<br>- What the world needs</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:300px\" data-rt-type=\"image\" data-rt-align=\"fullwidth\" data-rt-max-width=\"300px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6005911b73ad3288752b8fa5/604532053ae2c8b8b3fb7b6a_Untitled.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></div></figure><p>Combining these two words means that, because searching for our ikigai can be hard, receiving a kick in the right direction might represent a game-changing push in one's job search, eventually directing people in their own right direction; towards their ikigai. After all, finding your own fit in life can be beneficial for more people than just you.</p><blockquote>As bioengineers, we started thinking deeply about this after our graduation, finding ourselves puzzled by the countless possibilities that such a degree opened up to us, and facing some challenges to really understand how to properly design our future with the generalist education we received.</blockquote><p>This kind of education might represent a double-edged sword. On one side, its multidisciplinary nature gives a broader understanding of several disciplines, opening up endless applications. On the other side, if you come from a similar background, you can relate to the feeling of having fuzzy perspectives, and sometimes it can be difficult to give a clear-cut answer to the question<strong><em> \"what is it that you do?\"</em></strong>.</p><p>We realized that everything could be far easier by knowing more about what's outside of university and research while having more guidance and support to make the right decisions, starting from the university desks. But how does one build up his own perspective to design a career?</p><p>Kickigai answers this question in two fundamental ways:</p><p>- Being <strong>conscious</strong> of the available opportunities<br>- Being part of a <strong>network</strong> made of people who share the same objectives and passions</p><h3>Why and how we do it</h3><p>Every week we gather some amazing opportunities in health technology. This is a fundamental piece because we believe that making a conscientious choice requires by definition to acquire knowledge. And how can you choose something if you don't know it exists?!</p><p>This is the reason why we create a go-to place with <strong>up-to-date opportunities</strong>, that you might have had hard times discovering otherwise. For the same reason, we collect a <strong>list of companies</strong> in this field that you can filter according to your own specific interests.</p><p>Truth be told, being part of a network is the most valuable resource you'll ever get in terms of guidance and support to discover new possibilities. Every person's knowledge is shaped by experience and casual meetings, and learning from others is a privilege that can save you from making similar mistakes yourself.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of Kickigai is to <strong>connect professionals</strong> in this field with whoever is eager to advance their career in the amazing world of health technology, whether coming from a similar background or not. &nbsp;Being part of a community is a unique chance to meet peers, share daily challenges and discover unique opportunities. No one is a teacher and we are all in a continuous learning process that our community is here to amplify even more.</p><p><strong>So, let's bring ikigai and bioengineering forward, one career at a time.</strong><br></p>",

            "content_html": "<h3><strong>What is R&amp;D Engineering</strong></h3><p>An R&amp;D Engineer is in charge of the development of product prototypes while exploring its technical feasibility and overcoming development complications until it's ready to be placed on the market.</p><h3><strong>What does an R&amp;D Engineer do? A day in the life of an R&amp;D Engineer</strong></h3><p>An R&amp;D Engineer works closely with his teammates: since the development of new medical technologies requires a broad range of skills and knowledge, each team member needs to work in synergy with other professionals to ensure the success of the project.</p><p>Depending on the size of the company, the required tasks and assignments may vary and potentially overlap with those of a process engineer. However here are a few common ones:</p><ul><li>Study a specific process/device/state of art research to develop the product</li><li>Design specific experiments to understand experimental phenomena</li><li>Develop manufacturing processes</li><li>Design tests to validate expected outcomes</li><li>Use simulation software (e.g. CAD) to obtain mechanical or electrical prototyping</li><li>Reverse engineer final device or processes to understand underlying principles or troubleshoot potential issues</li><li>Presentation of results and writing of technical reports to technical and non-technical teammates</li><li>Communicate with suppliers</li><li>Supporting manufacturing engineers and technicians when needed</li></ul><p>The work of an R&amp;D Engineer requires to be continuously up-to-date about the state of the art in the medical area where the company or the project is focusing. &nbsp;This role is mainly site-related and requires interaction with the team and suppliers. Generally, there is no interaction with the final customer while some business trips might be required from time to time. On a weekly basis, 50% of the work is done in the lab while the other 50% at the desk. Remote working is only partially possible due to the nature of laboratory experiments.</p><h3><strong>Job outlook: stats and growth of this role</strong></h3><p>Giving the recent evolution of the medical field area, the role is expected to grow in the next years, since the employment of biomedical has predicted to grow 5% from 2019 to 2029, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">according to the US Bureau of statistics</a>.</p><p>Regarding the career progression within a company, after 2-4 years of experience as an R&amp;D engineer, you could get promoted to a managerial role, where you would focus more on project management and leadership than laboratory work. This promotion is not as common as one might think because not all great engineers thrive as managers and some engineers prefer to keep focusing on the technical aspects of a project while progressing in terms of responsibilities and seniority (e.g. senior engineer, principal engineer). Also, the promotion to a managerial role might depend upon the obtention of a PMP certification, an equivalent formation, or a cross-department traineeship. This is highly dependant on the size of the company and whether different roles are very structured or quite dynamic.</p><h3><strong>How much does an R&amp;D Engineer earn?</strong></h3><p>Entry-level (gross annual salary, average estimation)</p><ul><li>24k € - 28k € (Itay)</li><li>70k CHF - 80k CHF (Switzerland)</li><li>25000 £ - 30000 £ (UK)</li></ul><h3><strong>Types of R&amp;D Engineer</strong></h3><p>Depending on their background and technical expertise, an R&amp;D engineer might deal more with some specific technical areas compared to others (electronic and software rather than mechanics or materials). Moreover, depending on the company size, and interpretation of the role, an R&amp;D engineer can also work closer to manufacturing translation or regulatory/quality affairs.</p><h3><strong>Top skills needed</strong></h3><p>For sure, this role requires one to be always prone to new challenges and in particular, to never be scared of dealing with problems that may seem out of reach. This is why one needs to build a solid technical yet transversal knowledge (MSc in engineering or equivalent) and must be eager to keep on studying to be ready to jump on the next task which may require an additional effort to understand underlying scientific knowledge and technical skills. </p><p>To wrap up, these are some of the key required skills:</p><ul><li>Being a generalist. Especially in small to medium enterprises, you might be asked to do completely different tasks over time, so be brave to take on whatever it's required</li><li>Being self-organized and analytical, so to perform research in a well-structured way and being able to transform it into a real product</li><li>Being multi-tasking is essential to move forward the different phases of the project at the same time, cope with the complex nature of them and deal with needs from different stakeholders</li><li>Being able to communicate effectively and being concise while giving the essential information to technical and non-technical audiences. Clearly report the activities you are performing individually, to allow a good integration with the other teammate's tasks and to come up with clear execution plans for the entire team</li><li>Being ready to tackle problems with different perspectives, especially because in the very early stage of a project, the solution might not be straightforward, and looking at the problem with different eyes, might help you find a solution</li></ul><p>‍</p>",

            "content_html": "<h3>What is medical device scientific/clinical research?&nbsp;</h3><p>A scientific researcher is an umbrella term for all positions in the research group that are associated with a research project, without the 4-year commitment of a Ph.D., such as research assistant, (junior) researcher, or post-doc. In my case, since my project involves the development of a surgical device, I do see myself mostly as a medical device developer more than a researcher but there are some similarities in the way of working.</p><h3>What does a <strong>medical device clinical researcher</strong> do? A day in the life</h3><p>A clinical researcher can be a very different role depending on the actual project you join but also on the “seniority” of your role, which will bring more autonomy in the decision-making of the project.</p><p>But these are some of the things you can expect:</p><ul><li>Planning and organization of your research project&nbsp;</li><li>Literature search (which might also include clinical research)&nbsp; for better problem understanding, specific project requirements and current state-of-the-art</li><li>Educating yourself in the topics that you might need for the project (depending on the research group, you might find this information available through colleagues or supervisors, but you will also have to do some self-teaching)</li><li>Development of possible solutions that can address your research question&nbsp;</li><li>Preparation and testing execution – the types of tests you do will depend on the type of project you choose. It could involve mainly modelling or simulations but in the medical field, there is generally always the need to validate your results so you will most likely have to do some testing in the lab as well</li><li>Analysing data and reporting your results (ideally, in&nbsp; the form of a scientific article) – you might also need to use statistical tools during this phase&nbsp;</li><li>Supervision or Teaching: In any of these roles, it will be very likely that you will supervise interns for a Bachelor or a Master project, or even Ph.D. projects if you are a post-doc, that will fit within the scope of your work and help you to achieve your project goals within the time frame. Depending on the circumstances, you might also be involved in teaching activities for university students if your research group has an Education component as well</li></ul><p>I would say, generally speaking, the vast majority of a researcher’s time (70-90%) is spent on making progress for his/her project work and only the rest is spent on meetings or supervision.</p><p>The work is almost 100% individual, except when you are supported in your experiments by a lab technician or you outsource tasks to interns. Most projects are quite different from each other so it can be difficult to find collaboration opportunities with other colleagues. As a clinical researcher, projects usually tend to have a strong practical component, which means that about 35% of the work takes place in the lab and, for the rest, you only need a laptop and you could potentially comfortably work from home.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, working on medical device development within a research group is actually quite similar to the role of an R&amp;D engineer or, even a Process engineer, as you have to design a new device from scratch and ensure it could be prototyped and tested while taking into account medical device regulations and manufacturing processes of interest. The main difference is that in the research environment this work is very independent and autonomous, while in the industry, this type of work is mainly done together with a team.&nbsp;</p><h3>Job outlook</h3><p>Working as a researcher without being part of a Ph.D. program does not offer practically any growth opportunities in the academic world. This means, that you can look for other projects that might be interesting for you and apply for grants (under supervision) but you can’t expect to grow in terms of very different roles. Although medical research is always in demand given the number of unsolved problems at hand, if you think research is something you like, it should not be a problem to find a job. While for a short-term opportunity, you might be alright with just a MSc, investing in a PhD might be your only option for a long career in research.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a PhD, then you can move in the more or less linear Academia pathway: Post-doc 🡪 Principal Investigator 🡪 Assistant Professor 🡪 Full Professor. Additionally (or as an alternative after your PI role), you can go more into a Research Group Leader type of role. With seniority, you could also be able to join research committees, be more involved in the development of research programs and inter-research centers integrations. Practically speaking, this means taking a step back from where research actually happens and being more involved in strategic decisions and coordination.&nbsp;</p><h3>How much does a medical device clinical researcher earn?</h3><p>In the Netherlands, for all Academia roles, the salaries are transversal across universities, and you can find more information in the collective agreements. For a medical device clinical researcher, the expected salary ranges from 34k to 59k, depending on how many years of relevant experience – <a href=\"https://www.nfu.nl/sites/default/files/2020-07/CAO_University_Medical_Centres_2018-2020_as_of_1-1-2020.pdf\">Collective Agreement of University Medical Centre</a> For regular universities, in the Netherlands it is slightly less from 32k to 56k, again depending on how many years of relevant experience you bring – <a href=\"https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documents/Collective%20Labour%20Agreement%20Dutch%20Universities%202019%202020.pdf\">Collective Agreement Dutch Universities</a>. These salaries might be very different if you go into academia in other European countries.</p><h3>Top skills needed</h3><h4>Soft skills:</h4><ul><li>I would say the most important skill in this job is knowing how to work independently and being able to motivate yourself to push through</li><li>Proactivity and resourcefulness in finding your own solutions will get you further in this field</li><li>Being analytical and critical</li><li>Having a good foundation in statistics will always be helpful but if you are willing to learn it on the job it’s usually not a prerequisite.&nbsp;</li><li>Attention to detail and good organization skills are valuable to help you ensure a good quality of your work while having a broader view that will help you manage your time and ensuring you stay on track. Again these will make your life easier, but you might learn them the hard way anyway</li><li>You don’t necessarily have to be a great communicator and these roles are usually suited for introverts, but there is no doubt this skill will help you to make your research more understandable to others, especially when it involves a less technical audience</li><li>Also, patience is a virtue when you are working in research. Things will take time to happen</li></ul><h4>Technical skills</h4><p>Generally speaking, it will depend a lot on the area you wish to specialize in.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>First of all, you would need a Master’s Degree, but not necessarily in engineering; a background in medical sciences is also usually accepted. Regarding the specialization, there is usually a good degree of flexibility, and almost any engineering degree is considered enough, as long as you want to specialize in the medical field or have already done some projects in this area</li><li>Knowing a bit of programming, especially Matlab (unless you focus on Machine Learning and Data Science, where Python might be more useful), will be important to analyse the data from your results</li><li>Having had previous experience in research or relevant university projects (especially if related to the area where you wish to specialize) will make it easier to get the position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>‍</p>",
